This is a repository for a website that I am building for a friend and coworker of mine who someday wishes to open her own massage business.  I chose to build it using ASP.NET MVC as I believe it will be the easiest framework to update should she want additional functionality in the future (such as an option for online booking or payments).  A couple of notes:

1: There is a good deal of filler text as my client has been busy and unable to provide proper descriptions.

2: The aesthetics are subject to some major changes as my client has not made any definitive decisions regarding it (other than the layout of the navbar).

3: I do not have any current timeline as to when this might go live as my client is hesitant to start a small business at this time.


My personal timeline regarding this project:
  
  I am hoping to be done with the services page by the end of the week (6/5), and then will proceed to start working on the contacts page.
  Other goals include refactoring code to remove less redundancies and to place more into the code behind, make the app more accessible to   mobile devices, and to prep a reviews page (should the my client eventually desire to have one).
  
Thanks and stay tuned!

Update 6/5:
Finished Services page (still feels a little flat aesthetically, but not a whole lot I can do about that until I get more feedback from the client) so now I will just need to set up a contact page and it should be all set for initial implementation.  My overall progress will begin to slow next friday as my regular work will begin back up, but I will just take that into account when making new goals.

Update 6/13:
So hit a little bit of a snag and a visual studio update completely rewrote my bootstrap fiddling (as I wanted to use boostrap for the modals, but wanted to remove the other parts that were conteracting my own Site.css) so I am going to have to find a more permanent solution.  

Otherwise, I am going to look into learning more about Azure in order to better test my contact page.  So my current goals are to rework the CSS to make my use of bootstrap more permanent and then to take a course on Azure.  Once those are done, I will update this.
